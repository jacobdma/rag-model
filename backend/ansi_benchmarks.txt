‚úÖ Answer 1 (Trial 1-G ‚Äì Canonical Best)
Full Answer:

In ANSI B92.2M-1980, hard metric spline tolerances ensure interchangeability between mating parts by recognizing that proper assembly between splines is dependent only on the spline being within effective specifications from the tip of the tooth to the form diameter. The internal spline major diameter is shown as a maximum dimension and the external spline minor diameter is shown as a minimum dimension. The minimum internal major diameter and the maximum external minor diameter must clear the specified form diameter and thus require no additional control. All dimensions are for the finished part; any compensation that must be made for operations that take place during processing, such as heat treatment, must be considered when selecting the tolerance level for manufacturing. The Standard provides the same internal minimum effective space width and external maximum effective tooth thickness for all tolerance classes. This basic concept makes interchangeable assembly between mating splines possible regardless of the tolerance class of the individual members and permits a tolerance class mix of mating members. This arrangement is often an advantage when one member is considerably less difficult to produce than its mate, and the average tolerance applied to the two units is such that it satisfies the design need. If a fit given in this Standard does not satisfy a particular design need, the designer should consult the supplementary material or apply special analysis.

‚úÖ Answer 2 (Extended version mentioning 4 classes)
Full Answer:

In ANSI B92.2M-1980, hard metric spline tolerances ensure interchangeability between mating parts by using the same internal minimum effective space width and external maximum effective tooth thickness for all tolerance classes. This basic concept makes it possible to have interchangeable assembly between mating splines regardless of the tolerance class of the individual members. When a specific clearance or press fit is required, the change should only be made to the external spline by a reduction of, or an increase in, the effective tooth thickness and a like change in the actual tooth thickness. The spline terms and definitions given for ANSI B92.1-1970 (R1993) can be used in regard to ANSI B92.2M-1980. The dimensions and tolerances of splines made to the 1980 Standard can be calculated using the formulas given in Table 13. Four classes of side fit splines are provided: spline fit class H/h having a minimum effective clearance, cv = es = 0; classes H/f, H/e, and H/d having tooth thickness modifications, es, of f, e, and d respectively.

‚úÖ Answer 3 (Generalized Engineering Tolerancing Answer)
Full Answer:

Hard metric spline tolerances ensure interchangeability between mating parts by specifying the maximum allowable deviation from the desired shape and size. The tolerance is defined by the maximum allowable deviation from the nominal dimensions, which are the dimensions specified in the drawing. The tolerance is typically specified in terms of a percentage of the nominal dimension, such as 0.002 inches per inch. When a specific clearance or press fit is required, design strategies such as using a larger tolerance for the smaller diameter or using a larger manufactured tolerance for the larger diameter can be employed. Additionally, the spline should not be more than 0.006 inch per foot out of parallel with respect to the shaft axis, and radii at the corners of the spline should not exceed 0.015 inch.

üìÑ Full Answer:
In ANSI B92.2M-1980, hard metric spline tolerances ensure interchangeability between mating parts by providing the same internal minimum effective space width and external maximum effective tooth thickness for all tolerance classes. This basic concept makes it possible to have interchangeable assembly between mating splines regardless of the tolerance class of the individual members, and permits a tolerance class mix of mating members. When a specific clearance or press fit is required, the change can be made only to the external spline by a reduction of, or an increase in, the effective tooth thickness and a like change in the actual tooth thickness. The minimum effective space width is always basic and should always be retained when special designs are derived from the concept of this Standard.

Content Accuracy	10	All technical claims are accurate and taken directly from the standard
Conciseness	9	Very efficient; no fluff. Slight repetition in "effective tooth thickness" could be condensed

Handbook Fidelity	10	Mirrors handbook phrasing extremely closely; likely retrieved from exact text chunks
Formatting	9	Clean structure with good flow, though could slightly benefit from paragraphing if longer
